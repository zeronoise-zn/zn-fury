# ZeroNoise Fury Digital Intercom Amplifier

The ZeroNoise Fury Digital Intercom Amplifier uses adaptive noise cancelling technology to ensure crystal-clear communication, even in the most challenging rally environments and guaranteeing that every critical note and instruction is heard and understood, even in the loudest car. 

## Key Features and Benefits:

- **Adaptive Noise Cancelling:** Noise cancellation technology filters out unwanted background noise and guarantees a clear communication. Ambient noise is significantly reduced, enabling focused and clear communication crucial for understanding notes and instructions even in the noisiest cockpits.
- **Simple User Interface with Front Facing Buttons and Independent Twist Volume Controls:** Offers ease of use and flexibility, allowing drivers and co-drivers to adjust modes and audio levels individually and fine-tune sound feeling for optimal performance under any conditions.
- **Four Selectable Pre-Set Modes (Terrain, Boost, Engine, Road/Stage):** Each mode is designed for specific conditions. **Terrain** mode targets road surface noise, **Boost** amplifies voice volume, **Engine** mode suppresses engine noise, and **Road/Stage** mode blocks or allows external radio communication. These audio settings can be combined together for maximum clarity, allowing perfect tuning to specific stage environments and personal preferences.
- **Stage Mode for Focused Communication:** With stage mode selected, it is possible to stay focused during live stages by keeping only driver and co-driver communication and blocking external interactions.
- **Nexus Connectivity Helmets and Headsets Compatibility:** Allows connection compatibility to a range of products from intercom brands including ZeroNoise, Bell, OMP, Sparco and Stilo.
- **Versatile Power Supply Options:** Powered by a 9V internal battery or the vehicle's 12V supply, with a supplied filtered power cable to suppress electrical noise ensuring uninterrupted performance.
- **Audio Output for In-Car Camera Use:** The direct audio recording of both driver and co-driver's communication to in-car cameras is supported during stages. Hence driver and co-driver communication can be added to the recorded footage.
- **Audio In/Out Radio Connection:** The direct team communication via external radio is supported.
